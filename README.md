# Timsort-Algorithm-Visualizer
Timsort-Algorithm Visualizaer is a Computer Graphics Mini-Project - evaluated as part of my undergraduate laboratory curriculum. Timsort is a hybrid, stable sorting algorithm, derived from merge sort and insertion sort, designed to perform well on many kinds of real-world data. See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort) for more information.

In this project, we present 2D dynamic visualizations of the sorting process of the algorithm. We have used OpenGL library to create the 2D graphics.
